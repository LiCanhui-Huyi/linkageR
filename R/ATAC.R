#' Data frame for directly usable ATAC data
#'
#' This dataset is an ATAC-seq study of GDC TCGA Breast Cancer (BRCA) cohort with
#' 74 samples and 215,921 identifiers. The measurement unit is log2((count+5)PM)-qn for
#' all peak signal. ATAC-seq technology can help us better understand the open
#' chromatin regions in the genome, providing insights into the gene regulatory mechanisms
#' and potential treatments for breast cancer. This dataset provides comprehensive
#' ATAC-seq data that can assist researchers in analyzing gene expression profiles,
#' genomic structures, and other key features of breast cancer,
#' advancing breast cancer research and improving clinical treatment strategies.
