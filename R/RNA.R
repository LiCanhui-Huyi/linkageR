#' Data frame for directly usable RNA data
#'
#' This dataset is a study of gene expression RNAseq for GDC TCGA Breast Cancer (BRCA) cohort.
#' It contains 1217 samples and 60,484 identifiers. The data was collected using Illumina platform
#' and HTSeq method to obtain RNAseq gene expression data for each sample.
#' The measurement unit is log2(fpkm-uq+1), which can be used to investigate the
#' gene expression profile of breast cancer patients, and to understand the biology,
#' disease mechanisms, and potential treatment options of breast cancer.
#' This dataset provides important reference material for breast cancer research,
#' and reliable data sources for relevant research in medical and life sciences.
